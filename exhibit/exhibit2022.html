								<!-- <h3>Introduction</h3> -->
								<p><b>Connectedness</b> - within and between individuals - has been in the crosshairs of exciting 
									scientific inquiry and has also reached unprecedented levels and widespread awareness of crucial 
									societal issues. Specific examples are numerous: <br>
									
									<ul>
  									<li>The Human Connectome Project aims to map and elucidate the structural and functional 
									connections of the human brain. </li>
									<li>The availability of large-scale data and advancements in computer systems necessary to analyse 
									these data lead to exciting new developments in the mathematical theory and practical utility of 
									networks.  </li>
									<li>The enforced isolation and subsequent reconnection with others in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic 
									impacts our psychological and general physical health and reshapes the way we connect with ourselves 
									and others in our private and working lives. </li>
									<li>Movements for racial and gender equality and climate change are becoming more impactful through 
									global connections and international efforts. </li>
									<li>The popular game "Six degrees of separation" and a person's "Erd≈ës Number" are both based on 
									or are measures of connectedness. </li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								
								<p>In this context, we envision an exhibition under the theme "The Connected Brain", which explores 
									the topic of connectedness on three different axes:</p>

								<p><b>Axis I. (dis/re)Connection with self:</b> Axis one focuses on disconnection and reconnection with the 
								self. Enforced, or for that matter voluntary, isolation is a double-edged sword. While some revel in 
								the opportunity for self-reflection, self-love, and personal development, others struggle with the 
								loneliness that comes with it. On a more neuroanatomical level, learning new skills (e.g. piano playing) 
								is correlated with strengthened connections within the brain, while 'disconnection syndromes' can 
								have devastating effects on quality of life.</p>

								<p><b>Axis II. (dis/re)Connection with others:</b> The second axis focuses on connection, disconnection, and 
								reconnection with family, colleagues, and friends. As we move our work and our private/social lives 
								online, we inevitably re-shape our expectations from and responsibilities towards the networks to which 
								we belong. Also, sometimes voluntary segregation from a network with a bad influence or undesirable peer 
								pressure is the key to personal development, while other times finding the right group of people who 
								can bring out the best in us is the answer.</p>

								<p><b>Axis III. (dis/re)Connection with environment and nature:</b> The third axis focuses on personal connection 
								with environmental and societal causes. A crucial effect of the fact that our private and professional 
								lives become increasingly globalized is that our lives touch and are touched by many others from 
								different continents, cultures, and races. Importantly, through this interconnectedness, we become 
								aware of (and even passionate about) issues that may not have local relevance where we live and thus 
								previously we might have unknowingly ignored. </p>
