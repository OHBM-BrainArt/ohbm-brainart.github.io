								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p>This "Modular self-portrait" is meant to capture different aspects of Kendra herself and the relationships between them. 
									She was inspired to create it when she was reflecting on the different interpretations of this year's BrainArt theme, 
									particularly the notion of "connectivity within individuals". 
									She's just coming out of a severe illness, so this year has been very introspective for her. 
									But despite the inward focus of this piece, she wanted it to be interactive because 
									she has felt a bit starved for physical interaction when she was ill (and the pandemic didn't help). 
									As people move the squares around (or watch the animation of the squares moving) 
									she hopes that they will think about the different parts of themselves and the relationships between these parts -- 
									which aspects are more closely connected to others, and how that can change. 
									She chose wood as a material because she wanted it to feel a bit like a board game, 
									and bring a sense of play to the seriousness of the topic.</p>
								<hr />

								<h4>Relation to "The Connected Brain"</h4>
								<p>This work focuses on the aspect of "connectivity within the individual". 
									When Kendra considers this phrase as a neuroscientist, 
									she thinks of neural connections in the brain or connections between 
									psychological concepts like perception, cognition, emotion, etc. 
									But sometimes the artistic side of me is frustrated by how we try to simplify humans 
									to study them scientifically, particularly at the level of individuals. 
									We often need to ignore or "control" different aspects of people to study them at a population level. 
									But this necessarily means that they lose some individuality. 
									So she thought she'd take the theme and go in kind of the opposite direction, 
									considering what she personally thinks are the important aspects of her "self" as an individual, 
									and represent their complexity in the connections between them and in their move-ability.</p>
								<hr />

								<h4>Fun Story</h4>
								<p>"I was coming out of a period of illness when I started this project. 
									I still had quite low energy, and I ended up needing help from my family to finish it. 
									I love that I can look at this work and remember how each member of my family helped me. 
									I'm grateful that they never questioned that I should be spending my time/energy 
									(and theirs) on this odd project, which in some ways felt rather self-absorbed. 
									Reflecting on all of this, it feels very meaningful that they helped because 
									I had to rely on others a lot when I was sick earlier in the year. 
									More than that, I had to give myself permission to not feel guilty 
									about accepting help in order to actually heal."</p>
