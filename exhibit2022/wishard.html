								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p> The terms NFT, non-fungible token, and cryptocurrency have become more commonplace in 21st-century vernacular. This project began as a conversation between Tyler and his brother about blockchain technology and public-private ownership of medical data, particularly within the neuroimaging field with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. </p>

                                <p> Their concept is titled "Neuro-Fungible Tokens." They explored the relationship between brain data and digital art. In essence, how MRI provides a lens for understanding internal brain states and the structural aesthetics from which these functions follow. The brain, a visceral object of study, is the medium the observer must use to understand itself. In turn, the media is both the stimulus and the percept. </p>
                                    
                                <p> They use a 7-Tesla MRI of Tyler's brain, that of a neuroscientist, as a conceptual framework to encourage person-focused management of medical records and generate a broader discussion about the ownership of digital data, the technologic currency of today's modern age. In addition, they aim to bring the public artistic renderings of the brain to promote interest in neurophysiology and knowledge of neurological diseases. Their incentive to list these pieces as NFTs on the blockchain is to provide untapped resources for brain research. They conceive a tripart network linking the public, artists, and scientists at the intersection of neuroscience and society. </p>

								<h4>Relation to "The Connected Brain"</h4>
								<p> Axis I. Connection with self: The artwork created for this year's conference will 
                                    contain a series of digital pieces (NFTs) using a 7-Tesla MRI of Tyler's brain, 
                                    guided by inspiration from Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, the father of neuroanatomy, 
                                    and his quote stating that "any [person] could, if [they] were so inclined, be the sculptor of [their] own brain." 
                                    Here, he aims to explore how his experiences as a Ph.D. candidate at UCLA have influenced my conceptualization of neuroscience and career trajectory in STEM.</p>

								<p> Axis II. Connection with others: The pieces I will exhibit will become "Neuro-Fungible Tokens" (NFTs) on a blockchain that can be sold and traded. 
                                    Adapted from the popularized concept of non-fungible tokens, which are non-interchangeable units of data that have the potential to represent the intrinsic value of biomedical images as artwork digitally. 
                                    These images will form neuro-centric art series for brain awareness in a contemporary and reflective manner. These created pieces will have dynamic and interactive components whereby the conference attendees can engage with the digital images of my brain. 
                                    These features connect the observer with the brain of a neuroscientist and, by exchange, modifies the art form. By proxy, this represents how our social network and connection with others influence our brain's functional architecture. </p>

								<h4>Fun Story</h4>
								<p>The images the artist created so far have used the Processing software. 
                                    This platform provides a sketchbook for creating code within the visual arts. 
                                    They hope to expand the methods used to include more generative features and work with a friend and data scientist to develop more digital pieces. 
                                    They aim to create sets of images with a series of rules or creative constraints to produce varied brain images centered around a brain slice or visual orientation.
