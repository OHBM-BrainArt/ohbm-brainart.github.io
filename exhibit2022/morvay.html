								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p> Zsofia is an artist, illustrator and art teacher from Budapest. She finds drawing portraits to be mystical - how, just by studying their face and body in detail, she is able to discover their personality, their fears and inner beauty. She draws her inspiration from the "human connections” and how our world view can be altered by whom we love. More specifically, her work involves her family, whom she already knows deeply and with whom a connection is undeniably present. </p>
								<hr />

								<h4>Relation to "The Connected Brain"</h4>
								<p> She drew portraits of pairs with pencil, where she tried to illustrate each individual with a hint of a certain color, and how in the ’space between’ these colors merge and melt into one shared love or one shared consciousness. </p>
								
								<hr />

								<h4>Fun Story</h4>
								<p>Initially, she wanted to draw different people (lovers, friends, family, colleagues, strangers  and even humans with their pets but always in pairs). She hoped to illustrate how they are more together than they could be individually. But after she drew one of her sisters and her husband, her other two sisters immediately “demanded" to be part of the project. So in the end it became a family piece, which is interesting because although each drawing has two people on it, the whole collection involves yet another layer of connectivity - our family that we cannot (don't want to) say no to.</p>
