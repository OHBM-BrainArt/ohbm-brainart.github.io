									<h2>2022 Brain Art Exhibit</h2>
									
									<p><b>Connectedness</b> - within and between individuals - has been in the crosshairs of exciting 
									scientific inquiry and has also reached unprecedented levels and widespread awareness of crucial 
									societal issues. Specific examples are numerous: <br>
									
									<ul>
  									<li>The Human Connectome Project aims to map and elucidate the structural and functional 
									connections of the human brain. </li>
									<li>-The availability of large-scale data and advancements in computer systems necessary to analyse 
									these data lead to exciting new developments in the mathematical theory and practical utility of 
									networks.  </li>
									<li>-The enforced isolation and subsequent reconnection with others in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic 
									impacts our psychological and general physical health and reshapes the way we connect with ourselves 
									and others in our private and working lives. </li>
									<li>-Movements for racial and gender equality and climate change are becoming more impactful through 
									global connections and international efforts. </li>
									<li>-The popular game “Six degrees of separation” and a person’s “Erdős Number” are both based on 
									or are measures of connectedness. </li>
									</ul>
									</p>

									<p>In this context, we envision an exhibition under the theme “The Connected Brain”, which explores 
									the topic of connectedness on three different axes:</p>

									<p><b>Axis I. (dis/re)Connection with self:</b> Axis one focuses on disconnection and reconnection with the 
									self. Enforced, or for that matter voluntary, isolation is a double-edged sword. While some revel in 
									the opportunity for self-reflection, self-love, and personal development, others struggle with the 
									loneliness that comes with it. On a more neuroanatomical level, learning new skills (e.g. piano playing) 
									is correlated with strengthened connections within the brain, while ‘disconnection syndromes’ can 
									have devastating effects on quality of life.</p>

									<p><b>Axis II. (dis/re)Connection with others:</b> The second axis focuses on connection, disconnection, and 
									reconnection with family, colleagues, and friends. As we move our work and our private/social lives 
									online, we inevitably re-shape our expectations from and responsibilities towards the networks to which 
									we belong. Also, sometimes voluntary segregation from a network with a bad influence or undesirable peer 
									pressure is the key to personal development, while other times finding the right group of people who 
									can bring out the best in us is the answer.</p>

									<p><b>Axis III. (dis/re)Connection with environment and nature:</b> The third axis focuses on personal connection 
									with environmental and societal causes. A crucial effect of the fact that our private and professional 
									lives become increasingly globalized is that our lives touch and are touched by many others from 
									different continents, cultures, and races. Importantly, through this interconnectedness, we become 
									aware of (and even passionate about) issues that may not have local relevance where we live and thus 
									previously we might have unknowingly ignored. </p>

									<h3>2021 Brain Art Exhibit</h3>
									<p>2020 concluded the first decade of ‘Big Data' studies in neuroimaging. Our community has benefited from datasets 
									collected by the Human Connectome Project, UK Biobank, ADNI, ENIGMA, Psychiatric Genetic Consortium, and others. 
									With the 2021 Brain Art Exhibition and Competition, we celebrated the achievements of Big Data 
									neuroimaging projects, while acknowledging the unremitting suffering of individuals affected with brain disorders. 
									Our contributing artists to explored the theme of translating findings from Big Data studies to the 
									development of personalized treatments for brain disorders.<br>
									
									<br>Featured artists for the 2021 exhibt were:
									<br><a href="">Trina Lion</a>
									<br><a href="">Clara Soto</a>
									<br><a href="">Rachel Scott</a>
									<br><a href="">Batool Rizvi</a>

										<h4>"Big Data and Me" Axes</h4>
										<p>One axis of the exhibition examined topics such as inclusivity, diversity, representation of populations, 
										statistical power and inference in the large datasets.<br><br>
										The second axis explored the personal suffering of individuals affected with brain illnesses such as 
										schizophrenia, depression, age-related neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and autism. 
										We dedicated it to the artistic interpretations of the hope and expectation for recovery.<br><br>
										The third axis (i.e. the space between) hosted the pioneering ideas of linking these levels of observation,
										as interpreted by artists who are encouraged to explore the reciprocal effects between Big Data research and 
										personalized treatment, i.e. breaking of the barrier between research findings and treatment. Aspects of such 
										exploration may include (a) how an individual is affected by the group to which one belongs and how much we can 
										predict the characteristics of an individual from group membership. Conversely, how the criteria for inclusion of 
										individuals into a group define the group as a whole; (b) how Big Data findings will power new diagnostic and 
										treatment strategies that emphasize the individual variability; (c) artistic interpretations of the mathematical 
										concepts of ‘many to one mapping’ and ‘scale invariance’ and in particular, how these concepts relate to 
										neuroscience.<br></p>

										<h2>Past Brain Art Exhibits</h2>
										<h3>2020</h3>
										<p>NeuroDiversity was developed along three axes. Axis 1 gave underrepresented groups in neuroscience a voice. Axis 2 showcased art pieces by neurodiverse populations - for whom art can be a means of communication, an instrument for therapy, 
											or a source of solace and pleasure. Axis 3 was designed to highlight the geographic, ethnic and cultural richness within the OHBM community. Click <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ohbm2020brainart">here</a> to see the works from the OHBM 2020 Brain Art Exhibit</p>
