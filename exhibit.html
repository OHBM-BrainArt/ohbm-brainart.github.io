									<h2>Flavors of Reality</h2>

									<p> The Flavors of Reality theme explores the multifaceted dimensions of reality—from materialistic to virtual, from individual to collective. Reality stands as the ultimate pursuit of both neuroscientific and artistic inquiry. In neuroscience, one of our goals is to understand how the brain constructs, perceives, and interacts with the physical world around us, as it is. In art, our aim is often to reimagine, escape and transcend what science defines as “real”. In between these views, the emerging field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been pushing us to view reality as a construct that can be simulated, manipulated, and ultimately redefined.</p>
									
									<p>In this year's exhibition, we would like to invite people to reflect on the dynamic and ephemeral nature of reality, by bringing together concepts from cognitive neuroscience, art, technology, sociology, and philosophy. We would like to focus specifically on the concepts of perception and consciousness both from an individualistic and societal perspective. What does our brain's perception of reality tell us about the limits of human cognition and its altered states? How is art extending the boundaries of what is possibly real? How does consciousness shape our sense of self and society? How does AI challenge our ideas of what it means to <em>know</em> and <em>feel</em>? How do we wish to re-evaluate this landscape to better account for our different realities?</p>
									
									<p>Thus, <em>Flavors of Reality</em> is a product of interdisciplinary ideas inviting people to reflect on the subjective nature of reality. Artworks in this exhibition will serve as "fingerprints" of the brain urging us to redefine what it means to see, know, and connect with reality, in an era where technology, individual experiences, and society intertwine.</p>

									<p>The exhibition will be held at the <b>Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) Annual Meeting</b> between <b>June 24-28 2025</b>, in Brisbane, Australia. Artists and scientists are invited to submit their proposals for the exhibition in any form (still images, videos, sculptures, written word, interactive displays).</p>

									<ul>
										<li><b>When?</b> June 24 - 28, 2025 </li>
										<li><b>Where?</b> OHBM 2025 Annual Meeting. Brisbane, Australia. </li>

									<!-- <p>The 2024 OHBM BrainArt exhibition will explore the theme of <b>Beyond Borders</b>. 
										Artists and scientists can submit material in any form (still images, videos, sculptures, AI-generated images, written word, interactive displays). 
										No specific axes are provided this year: the notion of borders has no precise delineation and remains open for exploration. 
										We are hoping to receive a diversity of submissions within the general domains of neuroscience, society and climate change. 
									</p>

									<p>The exhibition will be held at the <b>Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) Conference</b> between <b>June 23-27 2024</b>, in <b>Seoul, Korea</b>. 
										While we would like to display all submitted material at the conference, this will unfortunately not be possible due to space constraints. 
										Therefore, submitted material will go through a selection process, and only selected art pieces will be displayed at our exhibition. 
									</p>
									<p>In order to ensure a smooth execution of the event, we would like to keep the following timeline.
									<li>By <b>5 February 2024</b>, provide us with a draft of your proposed work. Click <b><a href="https://forms.gle/qa2UP7AseQG4CrsP6">here</a></b> to submit your proposal.</li>
									<li>By <b>12 February 2024</b>, we will choose the works that fit the theme, exhibition space, and budget, and notify all artists.</li>
									<li>By <b>3 June 2024</b>, make sure that we have received your finished artwork (physical artwork that needs to be shipped - e.g., sculptures - will need to be dealt with on an individual basis).</li>
